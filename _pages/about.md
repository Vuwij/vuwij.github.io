Welcome to my website. I am a 4th year student completing my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto. My research interests are multiagent and limited order control systems. I am the founder and software team lead of UTRA Robosoccer. Canada's first humanoid robot team comprised of purely undergraduate students. In 2018, our team participated in the 2018 Robocup. We have a lot of talented people on our team. You can find out about our team and our awesome robot and team members at http://utrahumanoid.ca/. Although we were just undergraduate students and didn't win the Robocup. We still managed to make a name as Canada's first undergraduate team participating in the Robocup.

Research interests
======

I am also currently doing undergraduate capstone project on underactuated systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underactuation). An underactuated system is a system with fewer control torques than degrees of motion. An example of an underactuated system is the double pendulum. Where only one motor is controlling two degrees of freedom. We are currently still working on this project. Progress on the robot can be found here (https://github.com/Vuwij/acrobot)

I am also currently working on a quadcopter project. However this is not an ordinary quadcopter. This quadcopter has only two propellors and 2 airelons, and its designed to be able to fly with only two propellors. I am currently working on the simulation and the computer vision of this project and hopefully at the end of the year be able to dock two tailsitter robots into each other while in flying motion.
